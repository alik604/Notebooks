OMG these are hard :'(

Good thing in not taking discrete math 2. I'm omit-ing Nonhomogeneous Recurrence Relations.

## Generator Functions

  > converting counting problem into a generating function

There is an extremely powerful tool in discrete mathematics used to manipulate sequences called the generating function. The idea is this: instead of an infinite sequence (for example:  2,3,5,8,12,…)
we look at a single function which encodes the sequence. But not a function which gives the nth term as output. Instead, a function whose power series (like from calculus) “displays” the terms of the sequence. So for example, we would look at the power series 2 + 3x + 5x2 + 8x3 + 12x4 + ⋯ ,which displays the sequence 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 12 , … as coefficients.
