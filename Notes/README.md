#### These notes are posted so claims of me self-teaching data science and machine learning can be verified 

This is the repo for all my notes which I post online, as well as some contents that i want saved for quick reference (~4 cheat sheets) 

* Basic data analysis (done!)
* [Python datascience handbook (open source book, no need to make my own notes. iPython notebooks are posted)](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)
* [Machine learning -> theory](https://github.com/alik604/Notes/blob/master/machineLearning-general.markdown)
* [Linear algebra](https://github.com/alik604/Notes/blob/master/linearAlgebra.md)
