# Notebooks
> Most for of this is not updated, since I do most of my work in google colab. 

## iPython Notebook folder 

## Contents 

- Holt, Arima, LinearRegression, and SVM.ipynb 
   + non-ML approach to time series predictions  prediction
- My first LSTM -SPY pred.ipynb
   - code taken [from here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mhsbBTXEwUv9pb1N7MUpFIQ8r73_6-YB#scrollTo=9JnRa0vebWqT). I am learning LSTN for time series predictions by example. 
- Notebooks in *Time Series* for different algorithmic trading methods
   - Most my work in on Google Colab (I do most of my on in it)
   - Attempting to predict a random walk, after I am done, I will combine to non ML method I learned into “my best trading algo”.... I will strive to best that with deep learning
      - I doubt ill be able to without resorting to any cheap tricks (like only trading SPXL,SPXU; 3x leverage SP500 ETFs) 


## Datasets worked on: 

- MNIST
  - Just the “normal” CNN approach. Will revisit after I formally learn this in CMPT 419 at SFU (my university)
- Pima indians diabetes dataset
  - Evaluating effects of combinations of, Feature selection, Data cleaning, PCA for dim reduction 
  - TODO: autoencoder for feature selection 
- Credit card Fraud 
- Boston Housing
  - Also made a recommendation system 



### Datasets also worked on:

> Nothing worthy of note 

- Students-performance-in-exams
- Titanic
- CallCenter
- Lower Back Pain Symptoms
