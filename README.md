   - Most my work in on Google Colab (stuff here is not necessary final)
   - Attempting to predict a random walk, after I am done, I will combine to non ML method I learned into “my best trading algo”.... I will strive to best that with deep learning
      - I doubt ill be able to without resorting to any cheap tricks (like only trading SPXL,SPXU; 3x leverage SP500 ETFs)
